      "After my graduation from Uni I was not sure what career path to follow. My CV was on most job sites, but without interviews. Stackwisr gave me a roadmap that turned me into an analyst. After my training and CV help, I got great interviews and soon started a  fantastic career in business  analytics.",

I couldn’t believe it. I got the job with the NHS. It was my first interview after Uni”. Today I work as a senior BI analyst in Portsmouth."`,
